Not always cheap, but they'll[N]
always be reliable.[AN]
That's my promise.[AN]

Nathan.[AN][MidRight]
Good meetin' you.[AN]
You're an adventurer, right?[N]
Sit down a bit.[A] Take a nice[N]

some veterans picked it clean.[AN]
Give it some time, and I'm[N]
sure it'll fill up again.[AN]
Then, you can get into one of[N]
the best parts of adventurin'.[AN]
For now, though. Relax, and[N]
enjoy the atmosphere.[A][X]

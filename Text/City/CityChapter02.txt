##City02_Astarte
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Astarte][ToggleSmile]
Heya, Nathan.[AN][MidLeft]
Hey, Astarte. [...]Are you[N]
looking inside Bobby's?[AN][MidRight]
Can't say I wouldn't enjoy a[N]
nice meal.[A] Or a nice drink.[AN]
But it's a bad look when we've[N]
got Hedge business going on.[AN]
Plus, I'm flat broke.[AN]
Until I get my salary, I can't[N]
afford this place.[AN]
[...]Stuck making do with the slop[N]
the Guildleague serves.[AN][MidLeft]
Slop? I rather like it.[AN][MidRight]
You've never had the finest[N]
of tastes, Nathan.[AN][MidLeft][CloseEyes]
If it's edible, it's edible.[AN]
I think you're the one with[N]
too refined a palate.[AN][MidRight]
Whatever you say.[AN]
Anyway, I did see this place[N]
also runs some request board.[AN]
Keep an eye on that, I guess.[A][X]

##City02_Gore
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Gore]
Hm[...][A][ToggleSmile] Nathan, might we some[N]
room in our budget?[AN][MidLeft]
Depends, Gore. What do[N]
you have your eye on?[AN][MidRight]
Right there in the window.[N]
The Meisterkugel.[AN][MidLeft]
My[...]stir[...]koo[...]gull?[AN][MidRight]
Close enough. It's one of[N]
the finest guns around.[AN]
[...]Looks like it goes for[N]
around three thousand.[AN][MidLeft]
[...]Gore. We have two thousand[N]
to arm our entire guild.[AN]
Three on a single gun sounds[N]
a little bit very excessive.[AN][MidRight]
Hmph. I suppose. One day, though.[N]
We'll rake in gold untold.[AN]
And then beauty will be mine.[AN][MidLeft]
[...]You're right. One day.[A][X]

##City02_Cleone
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Cleone][MidLeft]
Can't say I've seen anyone[N]
use a whip like you before.[AN]
Would it be too forward to[N]
ask where you learned?[AN][MidRight]
I-I just[...] picked it up.[N]
Over time.[AN]
Never was good with swords.[N]
Too heavy for me, I think.[AN]
But the light smoothness of[N]
a whip[...][A] I-It felt right.[AN]
I-I'm still learning, though.[AN][MidLeft]
Could've fooled me.[AN][MidRight]
W-What about you, Nathan?[N]
Where'd you learn casting?[AN][MidLeft]
When I was younger, I saw a[N]
truly great mage spellcasting,[AN]
and knew that was just[...][N]
Well, what I wanted to do.[AN]
Astarte and Gore had always been[N]
a bit rougher than I,[AN]
and a bit more inclined towards[N]
traditional weaponry.[AN]
But I knew from that moment that[N]
I wanted to be something special.[AN]
And what's more special than fire[N]
that comes from my mind?[AN][MidRight]
H-Hehe[...] I guess you've[N]
got a point, Nathan.[AN]
[...]Thanks for checking in[N]
with me, Nathan.[AN][MidLeft]
Sure thing, Cleone.[A][X]

##City02_Benthus
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Benthus]
I suppose you did admirably.[AN]
But know that admirable is[N]
not a viable end goal.[AN]
Superior is the only thing[N]
worth striving for.[AN][MidLeft]
You did well yourself.[AN]
[...]I'd appreciate a bit less[N]
snark,[A] but you've made it[N]
clear one must earn your respect.[AN]
I do truly hope to earn it[N]
someday, Benthus.[AN][MidRight]
Then I hope you truly can[N]
impress me, dear leader.[A][X]

##City02_Guildmaster
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Guildmaster]
First time running around for[N]
guild preparations?[AN]
Must be a bit overwhelming, Hedge.[N]
Lemme give you a rundown.[AN]
For now, I'd stay close to the[N]
hall. Keep your life simple.[AN]
In the hall itself, I've got Gerson[N]
running the desk.[A] Ask him and he'll[N]
set you up with new recruits.[AN]
We've many adventurers willing to[N]
join guilds, and that includes yours.[AN]
Doesn't cost you anything, but you'll[N]
only get so many at a time.[AN]
Over yonder, we've got Benjamin's[N]
and Bobby's.[A] Benjamin's our main[N]
supplier, and Bobby runs the bar.[AN]
[...]As for me, I spend my time around[N]
the city fishing.[A] Perhaps one day[N]
I'll spill my secret spot to you.[AN]
[...]Better impress me real good if[N]
you want that, Nathan.[A][X]

##City02_BenjaminIntro
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Benjamin]
'aven't seen you here.[N]
A new guildster?[AN][MidLeft]
That's correct.[N]
Name's Nathan.[AN]
I'm told this is[N]
the guild's armorer?[AN][MidRight]
General store, really.[AN]
I'm Benjamin. Been doin' this[N]
smithin' thing for years.[AN][MoveRight][FarRight][Johanna]
Oooo! New customer![N]
I'm Johanna![AN]
It's a pleasure to[N]
meet you, mister![AN][Right]
That there's my pride and[N]
joy, Johanna.[A] She helps[N]
'round the shop sometimes.[AN]
Lil' darling, she is.[AN]
Anyways, stop by whenever[N]
you need some supplies.[AN]
Not always cheap, but it'll[N]
always be reliable.[AN]
That's my promise.[AN]
I'll also be gettin' in more[N]
stock in the comin' months,[AN]
so expect to see new things[N]
the longer you stick around.[AN][FarRight]
Daddy! Don't forget that[N]
new thing we're doing![AN][Right]
Ah, right.[A] I've been tryin' to[N]
work with some new materials.[AN]
If you ever take down a big monster[N]
in some novel way,[A] it might give[N]
you somethin' good to work with.[AN]
Bring it over and I'll try and[N]
get you something nice outta it.[AN][MidLeft]
Sounds wonderful.[N]
Thank you![AN][Right]
On that note[...][A][X]

##City02_BobbyIntro
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Bobby]
Hey, customer. New face?[N]
Welcome to Bobby's.[AN]
[...]I'm the Bobby.[AN][MidLeft]
Nathan.[AN][MidRight]
Good meetin' you.[AN]
You're an adventurer, right?[N]
Sit down a bit.[A] Take a nice[N]
breather real quick.[AN]
Normally, I'd be runnin' the[N]
city's request board,[A] but[N]
some veterans picked it clean.[AN]
Give it some time, and I'm[N]
sure it'll fill up again.[AN]
Then, you can get into one of[N]
the best parts of adventurin'.[AN]
For now, though. Relax, and[N]
enjoy the atmosphere.[A][X]

##City02_Bertram
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Bertram]
[...]New blood.[AN][MidLeft]
W-Wha-[AN][MidRight]
Hmph. I didn't say bark, dog.[AN]
Just observin'. [...]See yourself[N]
off now, little man.[AN]
This's my corner of Bobby's.[N]
Not yours.[AN][MidLeft]
[...][A][X]

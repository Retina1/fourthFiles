##C2_Opening_1
[FarLeft][Astarte][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Guildmaster][FarLeft]
Mornin', boss.[AN]
[...]Can't believe we're[N]
at that point already.[AN]
Thought it'd be like, a[N]
good few weeks.[AN]
But no. We're already a[N]
guild.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]Wow.[AN][MidRight]
I don't see point in mucking[N]
up the process.[A] You're some[N]
skilled youths already.[AN][ToggleSmile]
That said, I'd like you to[N]
meet someone who'll muck it up.[AN][MoveFarRight][Right][Rat]
[...][AN][Left]
[...]Hello there?[AN][Right]
[...][AN][FarRight]
Ah, right. Context.[AN]
Every guild is under purview of[N]
a member of the Guildboard.[AN]
To keep the unexciting part brief,[N]
they're an administrative body.[AN]
Any Guild-related issues go by[N]
them.[A] Any policy of the League[N]
is approved by them.[AN]
And this fella here is your[N]
representative. Rat.[AN][FarLeft]
[...]Rat?[AN][Right]
[...][AN][FarRight]
They don't say much.[AN]
Hope your handwriting's[N]
up to snuff, Hedge.[AN][Clear][Left]
Well, nice to meet you, Rat.[AN]
I trust you to look out for[N]
our best interests.[AN][Right]
[...][AN][FarRight][Gore]
Nathan. We ready for our job?[AN]
Seems like Cleone and Benthus[N]
already grabbed our assignment.[AN]
Some monsters overwhelming a[N]
local guard post.[AN]
Nothing all too major.[AN][Left]
Already? No rest, I guess.[N]
We'll be back later, Rat.[AN]
Then we can all properly[N]
get ourselves introduced.[AN][Clear][FarRight]
[...]Rat, was it? Gore.[N]
Sorry to be brief.[AN][Clear][FarLeft]
Suppose that's my queue, too.[N]
The name's Astarte.[AN]
I'll return triumphant, Rat.[AN][Clear][Right]
[...][A][ToggleSmile][A][X]

##C2_Opening_2
[FarLeft][Gore][Left][Nathan][Right][Cleone][FarRight][Benthus]
Are you about ready?[N]
Ready to see my glory?[AN][FarLeft]
Ready for you to tone it[N]
down a peg, perhaps.[AN][Right]
I'm[...] truly sorry about him.[N]
He's more reliable than he seems.[AN]
I swear.[AN]
[...]Enough of him, though. Tell[N]
me about yourself, Nathan.[AN][Left]
What really is there to say?[AN]
Just a young man trying to do[N]
what he can to be remembered.[AN]
That's all three of us, really.[AN][FarLeft]
Glory's nice. The money'll[N]
be nicer, I think.[AN][Right][Clear][Astarte]
I must digress.[AN]
Glory shall be more[N]
than ample payment.[AN][FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah. Perhaps you and I are[N]
of the same mind, lady.[AN][Right][ToggleSmile]
[...]That said, I think part of[N]
it's just[...] How do I put it?[AN]
The three of us are in this for[N]
good, as one.[A] I can't just go[N]
and leave my closest friends.[AN]
Not for all the glory in Asketa.[AN][FarRight]
Hmph. A lofty principle.[AN][FarLeft][Clear][Guildmaster]
You all can fight over your why[N]
later.[A][FarLeft] Catch, Nathan.[AN][Left][MoveLeft]
[...]I hardly think we need a[N]
map for this task.[AN]
Is it not right outside[N]
the city?[AN][FarLeft]
Much as I like cartography,[N]
the map's unimportant.[AN]
Mainly just a vessel for[N]
what really matters.[AN]
The important part's the[N]
League's seal over here.[AN]
Just a bit of proof that[N]
you're with the League.[AN]
Not with Asketa's military.[AN]
Bit of a precaution, what[N]
with Belvarus's movements.[AN][Right]
You think they'd dare come[N]
near Hirschring?[AN][FarRight]
It would be very within[N]
their insidious nature.[AN][FarLeft]
I doubt it, but it never hurts.[AN]
Can't risk the imperials getting[N]
on the League's back,[A] if they[N]
do show up and stir something.[AN]
And the League's got slightly[N]
better Belvarusi relations.[AN]
Compared to what the empire[N]
itself has, in any case.[AN]
Again, it's probably overkill.[N]
But we can't be too safe.[AN]
Not with the Belvarus Republic.[AN][Left]
[...]Right. Well if that's all,[N]
no time like the present.[AN][FarLeft][Clear][Gore]
You're tellin' me.[AN][Right]
Just say the word.[AN][Left]
Hedge, move out![A][X]

##C2_Opening_3
[FarLeft][Astarte][Left][Gore][Right][Nathan][FarRight][Cleone][FarLeft]
Our first real job.[N]
[...]Excited, Gore?[AN][Left]
I won't say I won't enjoy[N]
shooting some monsters.[AN][FarRight]
I can't see any humans around.[N]
Should just be us and them.[AN][Right]
Makes it easy then.[AN]
Benthus![AN][FarLeft][Clear][Benthus]
No need to shout, boy.[AN]
[...]Dear leader.[AN][Right]
I've gathered you have a bit[N]
more experience than us.[AN]
And your armor looks like[N]
it's fairly durable.[AN][FarLeft]
I suppose I shall lead the[N]
front. Sing of my glory.[AN]
Just don't make me do all[N]
the work. It's beneath me.[AN][Right]
Thank you, Benthus.[AN]
And don't worry. I plan for[N]
us all to train ourselves.[AN][FarRight]
You can count on me.[AN]
I'm not that strong[...][N]
But I can get in quick.[AN]
And I think my whips can[N]
keep them under control.[AN][Right]
Excellent. Gore, Astarte.[N]
[...]I trust you two.[AN][Left]
Got it.[AN][FarRight][Clear][Astarte]
And I won't disappoint.[AN][Right][Event]
Then advance, everyone![N]
Let's clean 'em up![A][X]

##C2_DoorHint
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Benthus]
Dear leader. How ever shall[N]
we handle that closed room?[AN][MidLeft]
[...]We open the door? Might take[N]
a bit of force,[A] but I'd think[N]
any of us could do it.[AN]
Even through a lock.[AN][MidRight]
And what if there happens to[N]
be treasure within?[AN]
Are those spoils also ours?[AN][MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]You're a noble, Benthus.[N]
Do you need to steal?[AN][MidRight]
It is simply using resources[N]
most optimally, Nathan.[AN][MidLeft]
Fine. Sure. We can probably[N]
break any chest locks too.[AN]
Guess it's preparation for[N]
real expeditions.[AN][OpenEyes]
And if it's life or death,[N]
I guess it may matter.[AN][MidRight]
Heh. I win again.[AN][MidLeft]
[...]Sure?[A][X]

##C2_Ending_1
[FarLeft][Astarte][Left][Nathan][Right][Benthus][FarRight][Cleone]
we win[A][X]

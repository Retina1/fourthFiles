Where did it go wrong?[AN]
Where did you lose the road?[N]
Where did any of us lose it?[A][X]

##C1_Premonition_Gore1
Was it all worth it?[AN]
To have and to lose it all?[N]
Do you miss being blind?[A][X]

##C1_Premonition_Astarte2
Who'll remember me?[N]
Who'll remember you?[A][X]

##C1_Opening_1
[MidLeft][Nathan]
[...][AN][FarFarRight][Astarte]
Nathan![A][MoveMidRight]
Now's not the time[N]
to drift off, bud.[AN][MidLeft]
Right. My bad.[AN]
Just a passing fit.[N]
[...]Where's Gore?[AN][MidRight]
Filling out the last[N]
of the paperwork.[AN]
The Guildleague sure[N]
doesn't make it easy.[AN][MidLeft]
Sure wouldn't think that with[N]
how common adventurers are.[AN]
[...]You still sure this all's[N]
a good idea, Astarte?[AN][MidRight][CloseEyes]
For the love of[...][AN][OpenEyes]
I swear you're far too[N]
indecisive, Nathan.[AN]
This is what we've dreamed[N]
of all our lives.[AN]
Why we came to Hirschring![AN]
If you're afraid to die,[AN]
better to die an adventurer[N]
than to die a coward.[AN][MidLeft]
Right, right.[AN][FarFarLeft][Gore]
Too late to back out anyway.[N]
Paperwork's already done.[AN][Close][MoveFarLeft][MidLeft][MoveLeft][MidRight]
I say if our dearest friend wishes[N]
to betray our dream,[A] he's hardly[N]
a friend of ours at all.[AN][FarLeft]
You really think the three of[N]
us can't manage, Nathan?[AN]
[...]You think you know a guy.[AN][Left]
No, you're right. Just[...][N]
Nervous, I guess.[AN][FarLeft]
All good. Can't say I'm[N]
not a bit nervous, myself.[AN]
But do keep it in check.[AN]
Once the Guildmaster's here,[N]
it's practical exam time.[AN][MidRight]
Hah! That'll be nothing for me.[N]
You've both seen my swordplay![AN][Left]
The swordplay that tore your[N]
father's fence to shreds?[AN][FarLeft]
As if your casting's any more[N]
refined.[A] [...]Can't say my gunning's[N]
any ahead either, sadly.[AN]
But that's part of the process.[N]
Learning and growing.[AN][MidRight][Smile]
Right! Soon, all Asketa shall[N]
know my stellar glory![AN][FarLeft][Smile]
We'll have to see about that.[AN][FarFarLeft][Guildmaster]
Aight, new applicants.[AN]
Lookin' for a fella named[N]
Nathan! Step forward![AN][Left]
[...]Did you write down[N]
the wrong name, Gore?[AN][FarLeft]
Nope. Figured you being our[N]
representative made sense.[AN]
You're far more measured than[N]
either one of us.[AN]
Less likely to make a scene.[AN][MidRight]
Are you trying to call[N]
him boring?[AN][FarLeft]
Not one bit.[AN]
Trust me, Nathan.[N]
You'll do fine.[AN][Left]
If you're certain.[A][X]

##C1_Opening_2
[MidLeft][Nathan][MidRight][Guildmaster]
Mhm[...] Nathan, correct?[AN]
Tell me, lad. What makes you[N]
lot think you got the stuff?[AN]
I've seen hundreds of youths[N]
over my time as Guildmaster,[AN]
and I always ask them that[N]
very question.[AN][MidLeft]
To[...] To be honest, it was[N]
hardly my idea.[AN]
Gore and Astarte out there[...][N]
They're the real adventurers.[AN]
I just can't face the idea[N]
of leaving them behind.[AN]
So here I am with them.[AN][MidRight]
Loyalty's good a cause as any.[AN]
[...]Just hope it'll hold fast.[AN]
In this life, there's no room[N]
to doubt your line of work.[AN]
You live and die on your instinct.[N]
Hesitation'll get you in a flash.[AN][MidLeft]
Why are you telling me this?[AN][MidRight]
Part of judging your character.[N]
All of this is true, of course.[AN]
But I see in your eyes that for as[N]
uncertain as you are about this,[AN]
you're also unwavering. Unafraid.[N]
[...]Things I look for in a recruit.[AN]
Get your mates and follow me.[N]
Your initiation trial begins now.[AN][Clear][MidLeft]
Of[...] Of course, sir![A][X]

##C1_Opening_3
[MidLeft][Guildmaster]
Hm. A caster, a gunner, and what[N]
I believe is[...] a spellsword?[AN]
You'll match well with[...] I'd say[N]
Cleone and Benthus.[AN]
Two recent additions to our numbers[N]
who're without guildmates.[AN]
They've proven themselves already,[N]
so now you can prove yourselves.[AN]
Step forward, initiates![A][X]

##C1_Opening_4
[MidLeft][Guildmaster][Right][Cleone][FarRight][Benthus][Right]
Ready, Guildmaster![AN][FarRight]
Hmph. This better[N]
be interesting.[AN][MidLeft]
Your task is simple.[AN]
Best this small force I've[N]
assembled in combat.[AN]
Treat this as seriously as you[N]
would any real world skirmish.[AN]
If you're knocked out, initiates,[N]
I fear I'll have to send you off.[AN]
[...]But I know you've the resolve[N]
to see this trial through.[AN]
I shall watch from up here.[AN]
Don't mind my presence, or[N]
that of my apprentice.[AN][FarRight]
You've even got an imperial[N]
troop there with you, sport.[AN]
What, thinking of whisking us[N]
off to the military after this?[AN][MidLeft]
Benthus. This soldier is just[N]
observing guild activity.[AN][FarRight]
Well, then.[AN]
Let them observe[N]
my superiority![AN][Right][CloseEyes]
[...][AN][MidLeft]
Ahem. Let the trial[...] commence![A][X]

##C1_Opening_5
[MidLeft][Gore][Right][Nathan][FarRight][Astarte][Right]
Alright[...] Alright![AN][Smile]
We're doing this![AN][FarRight]
Remember our strategy.[N]
I'll take the front.[AN]
You two support from[N]
the rear.[AN][MidLeft]
'Course. We'll make 'em[N]
all know our names.[AN][Right]
Nothing to it, then![A][X]

##C1NathanBattle
[MidRight][Nathan]
I[...] I can do this.[N]
Nothing to fear.[AN]
Exactly like we've[N]
been practicing.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[...]I've got this.[A][X]

##C1NathanCleoneBattle
[MidRight][Nathan]
Is[...] Is that[N]
a whip?[AN][Clear][MidLeft][Cleone]
It[...] It is.[AN]
I-I'm[...] I'm good[N]
with it.[AN][Clear][MidRight][Nathan]
I wasn't[...][AN]
Just never something[N]
I'd expect as a weapon.[AN]
[...]Right.[N]
We should fight.[A][X]

##C1NathanBenthusBattle
[MidLeft][Benthus]
My name is Benthus.[N]
Remember it well.[AN]
It is a name that[N]
shall ring in history.[AN][Clear][MidRight][Nathan]
Perhaps it will.[A][N]
But I'd like mine to[N]
as well, one day.[A][X]


##C1AstarteBattle
[MidRight][Astarte][ToggleSmile]
Nothing's gonna stop[N]
me now![A] I've worked[N]
my whole life for this![AN]
You'll soon all sing of[N]
me, Astarte![A][X]

##C1AstarteCleoneBattle
[MidRight][Astarte]
A dark hunter![N]
A worthy foe![AN][Clear][MidLeft][Cleone]
Are[...] Are you afraid?[N]
I-I'm[...] sorry.[AN]
If I'm bothering you,[N]
I can just[...] leave[...][AN][Clear][MidRight][Astarte]
Hardly! I'm looking[N]
forward to this.[A][X]

##C1AstarteBenthusBattle
[MidLeft][Benthus]
My name is Benthus.[N]
Remember it well.[AN]
It is a name that[N]
shall ring in history.[AN][Clear][MidRight][Astarte]
Who starts a conversation[N]
like that?[A] [...]Name's[N]
Astarte. En garde![A][X]

##C1GoreBattle
[MidRight][Gore]
Locked and loaded.[N]
Target in sight.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Nothing more to it.[A][X]

##C1GoreCleoneBattle
[MidRight][Gore]
[...]Hm.[AN][Clear][MidLeft][Cleone]
A-Are you alright[...][N]
Gore, right?[AN][Clear][MidRight][Gore]
Fine. Just surprised to[N]
see a dark hunter.[AN][Clear][MidLeft][Cleone]
Oh[...] I can just[...][AN][Clear][MidRight][Gore]
You've done nothing[N]
wrong.[A] Just don't[N]
see 'em much.[AN]
[...]Let's focus on[N]
our trial, please.[A][X]

##C1GoreBenthusBattle
[MidLeft][Benthus]
My name is Benthus.[N]
Remember it well.[AN]
It is a name that[N]
shall ring in history.[AN][Clear][MidRight][Gore]
[...]Yeah, sure.[N]
Gore.[AN]
Good to meet you.[A][X]

##C1NathanDefeat
[MidRight][Nathan]
I'm[...] sorry, guys[...][AN]
I[...] yield.[AN][Clear][MidLeft][Guildmaster]
[...]I had hoped for better.[N]
Perhaps another day.[A][X]

##C1AstarteDefeat
[MidRight][Astarte]
No[...] Not like this[...][N]
How could I blow it?[AN][Clear][MidLeft][Guildmaster]
[...]I had hoped for better.[N]
Perhaps another day.[A][X]

##C1GoreDefeat
[MidRight][Gore]
Damn it[...] I guess I[N]
should be thankful[...][AN]
I wasn't cut out[...][N]
for this[...][AN][Clear][MidLeft][Guildmaster]
[...]I had hoped for better.[N]
Perhaps another day.[A][X]

##C1CleoneDefeat
[MidLeft][Cleone]
You[...] got me.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Well done.[A][X]

##C1BenthusDefeat
[MidLeft][Benthus]
Hmph. I was merely[N]
holding back.[AN]
If we rematch, don't[N]
expect this again.[A][X]

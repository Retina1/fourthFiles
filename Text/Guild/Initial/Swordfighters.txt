##Guild_Marag_Intro
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Marag]
'ey, kid. You wanna[N]
piece of me?[AN][Left]
N-No. I mean[...][AN]
Y-Yes? I'd[...] like to[N]
speak with you.[AN][MidRight]
Right, then. Name's Marag.[AN]
Remember the Old War? I[N]
was forged in it, kid.[AN][Left]
Can't say I do.[N]
Wasn't exactly[...] born.[AN][FarLeft]
Hey, you never know.[AN]
Might've seen it in[N]
a past life.[AN][MidRight]
Twenty eight years ago, those[N]
Asketan dastards did this.[AN]
See my eye, kid? Ate this[N]
wound in my first ever fight.[AN]
Took two years to heal enough[N]
to fight again.[AN][Left]
Sorry to hear. [...]Bit surprised[N]
you're here, then.[AN]
If Asketa did this.[AN][MidRight]
There's no Guildleague in[N]
Belvarus. No glory.[AN][FarLeft]
Guess I've got a monopoly[N]
on this guild thing.[AN][Left]
[...]Wait. The Old War ended[N]
twenty seven years ago.[AN]
[...]How much have you fought?[AN][MidRight]
Unimportant, kid.[N]
[...]Please. I need this.[A][X]

##Guild_Marag_Accept
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Marag]
You won't regret this, kid.[AN][Clear][FarLeft]
Now that I say it, guess that's[N]
why we get so many Belvarusi.[A][X]

##Guild_Marag_Deny
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Marag]
[...]Hmph. Scram, brat.[AN][Clear][FarLeft]
I'd say catching him on[N]
that math's a bit rude,[AN]
but I guess that's just[N]
what mages do.[A][X]

##Guild_Marag_Return
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Marag]
Oh? Crawling back, kid?[AN][Left]
You yourself said you[N]
need this.[AN][MidRight]
Do you want me, or do[N]
you want to lecture me?[A][X]

##Guild_Cam_Intro
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Cam]
Heya, there. Name's Cam.[AN]
You need yourself a sword?[N]
I'll do the best I can.[AN][Left]
Name's Nathan.[N]
What brings you here?[AN][MidRight]
Just tryin' to help the others[N]
back at the orphanage.[AN]
Bit more coin for them would[N]
never hurt.[AN][FarLeft]
Coin for an orphanage.[N]
How do you say no?[AN][X]

##Guild_Cam_Accept

to change your mind.[A][X]

##Guild_Cam_Return
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Cam]
You're rethinking me?[AN]
I'll work three times[N]
as hard, I swear![A][X]

##Guild_Puzon_Intro
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Puzon]
Hey, look at this.[N]
The old fool's wealthy.[AN][Left]
[...]What? Are you talking[N]
to Guildmaster?[AN][FarLeft]
Think nothing of it, Nathan.[AN]
This one's name is Puzon.[N]
Some kinda foreign sellsword.[AN]
I'm pretty sure he just picked[N]
up vocabulary walking around.[AN]
[...]Can't think of a better reason[N]
for his constant non-sequiturs.[AN][MidRight]
[...]Typical.[AN][Left]
[...]Sure.[AN]
Your blade arm's pretty[N]
solid looking, I guess.[AN]
What brings you to Asketa[N]
of all places, anyway?[AN][MidRight]
The merchant.[AN][Left]
The merchant?[AN][FarLeft]
The merchant.[N]
Clearly.[AN][MidRight]
Be prepared.[AN]
You are to be witness to a[N]
power that overwhelms all![AN][FarLeft]
Damn, Nathan. Seems[N]
like a keeper.[A][X]

##Guild_Puzon_Accept
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Puzon]
We must be steel blades with[N]
which to pierce the enemy.[AN][Clear][FarLeft]
Honestly, that's more comprehensible[N]
than anything else he's said.[AN]
He'll be your steel blade.[N]
Sounds like a good deal, kid.[A][X]

##Guild_Puzon_Deny
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Puzon]
Heh. Looks like you've[N]
breathed your last![AN][ClearFace][Left]
Is that a threat?[AN][FarLeft]
I[...] don't know.[A][X]

##Guild_Puzon_Return
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][Puzon]
Do you regret the outcome[N]
of your actions?[AN][Left]
It's[...] not that[N]
serious, Puzon.[AN][FarLeft]
Wasn't the question.[N]
Do you have regrets?[AN][Left]
Don't encourage him.[A][X]

##Guild_CoastKid_Intro
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][CoastKid]
[...][AN][Left]
Did[...] they let a kid in?[AN][MidRight]
Not just any kid.[N]
Coast Kid.[AN]
Remember that name if you[N]
know what's good for you.[AN][Left]
[...][AN][FarLeft]
You 'eard her. If you[N]
know what's good for you.[AN][Left]
Right. Coast Kid. What can[N]
you bring to a guild?[AN][MidRight]
Big sharp things.[AN]
Want a guy cut? I'll[N]
cut 'im real good.[AN]
Cut many guys up and down[N]
the Hirschring coastline.[AN]
'ow I ended up 'ere.[AN][Left]
Coastline? Isn't this[N]
city landlocked?[AN][FarLeft]
Don't question it, kid.[AN]
She's skilled 'nough to[N]
have done it anyway.[AN]
[...]Of course, that crime[N]
spree brought her here.[AN]
One of our numbers finally[N]
managed to pin 'er down.[AN]
The city thought hanging a[N]
kid'd look real bad.[AN]
So, we got some coin, and[N]
now we're makin' her work.[AN]
Call taking her with you[N]
some manner of parole.[AN][MidRight]
You can trust me.[N]
[...]Look at my face.[AN]
Ain't it a trusty face?[A][X]

##Guild_CoastKid_Accept
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][CoastKid]
Wait, really?[AN][Smile]
[...]Yippee![AN][Clear][FarLeft][Smile]
Is it too late to say you're[N]
responsible for any crimes?[A][X]

##Guild_CoastKid_Deny
[FarLeft][Guildmaster][Left][Nathan][MidRight][CoastKid]

I'll be here. Crying.[AN]
Because you're a meanie.[AN][Clear][FarLeft]

Got places to be,[N]
treats to snack on.[AN][Left]

Well, she IS a kid.[N]
Gotta feed her good.[A][X]
